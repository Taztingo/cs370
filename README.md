Complex problems from sites, with an online judge, to improve our coding ability.

Problems must be completed in C, C++, and Java. We have two weeks to complete 3 problems in each of these languages. The objective is to collaborate and solve the problems in each of these languages. Code reviews will also be conducted to further improve our algorithms, and walk through ability.
